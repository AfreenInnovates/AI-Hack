# Beyond Sight  

## Inspiration  
Visual information often remains inaccessible to blind and low-vision individuals, creating barriers to independence. Our mission is to break those barriers using technology.  

## What it does  
Beyond Sight allows users to upload an image, processes it to extract key details, and delivers those insights via audio, making visual content accessible and intuitive.  

## How we built it  
We used a combination of:  
- **Natural Language Processing**: To structure the extracted data for better understanding.  
- **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Converts text-based insights into clear, audible speech.  
The project integrates these technologies into a seamless and user-friendly interface.  

## Challenges we ran into  
- Ensuring high accuracy in OCR and object detection across diverse image types.  
- Designing an intuitive and accessible interface for blind and low-vision users.  
- Optimizing the system for real-time processing and delivery of audio output.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Building a functional prototype that empowers users to access visual information.  
- Creating a tool with real potential to improve daily accessibility for many individuals.  

## What we learned  
- The importance of user-centric design for accessibility tools.  
- Addressing the diverse real-world challenges faced by visually impaired users.  

## What's next for Beyond Sight  
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand speech and text processing to support global languages.  
- **Advanced Contextual Analysis**: Provide deeper insights into image content, such as scene descriptions.  
- **Offline Functionality**: Develop a lightweight version for devices without internet connectivity.  
- **Speech-to-Speech Enhancements**: Improve conversational AI for more natural and dynamic voice interactions.  
- **Wearable Integration**: Extend support to wearable devices like smart glasses for real-time assistance.  

## Get Started  
1. Upload an image through the platform.  
2. Let the system process the image and extract key details.  
3. Listen to the audio output that describes the image content.
